# Model-Rocket-Sim
A python based mathematical physics simulator for model rocketry.

By adding in some details of your model rocket you can calculate it's estimated altitude including aerodynamic effects.

The calculator takes the dry weight (g), diameter (cm), propellant weight (g) and drag co-efficient (dimensionless)
  
There are 4 motor profiles (A,B,C or D) taken from the NAR website and hard-coded these are used for the aerodynamic profile.

The main output is a max altitude

The other outputs are plots of the burn characteristics and a plot of the full flight profile.

note: this calculator assumes no parachute! That will be added later.
